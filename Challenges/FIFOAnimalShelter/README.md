# Animal Shelter
Whiteboard Challenge for Day #12
**Whiteboarding partners**: Jesse Atay & Judah Hunger

## Challenge
Write a class that holds only Dog and Cat objects, which operates using a First In, First Out approach. The class should include an Enqueue method that adds a Dog or a Cat to the back of the queue, and a Dequeue method that returns the longest waiting animal of a specified type (or the longest waiting animal if no preference is chosen).
