## Challenge
Write a method that takes a binary tree as an argument, and then modifies the tree so that nodes with a value divisible by 3 have their value replaced with Fizz, nodes with a value divisible by 5 have their value replaced with Buzz, and nodes that are divisible by both 3 and 5 have their values replaced with FizzBuzz.
