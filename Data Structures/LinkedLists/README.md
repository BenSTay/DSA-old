# Linked List
**Author**: Benjamin Taylor  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
A Linked List is a data structure consisting of one or more Nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node on the list. The Linked List contains references to the node at the front of the list and the current node (this is used for navigating the list).  
![LinkedList](https://github.com/btaylor93/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/raw/master/assets/linkedlist.jpg)
This implementation uses two classes: a Node class and a LinkedList class. Both classes have two properties (Value and Next for Node, Head and Current for LinkedList) and a constructor. The LinkedList class also contains methods to add and find elements in the list.  
Linked Lists are useful because unlike arrays, they don't have a set length and therefore never need to be resized in order to add more elements to the list.
